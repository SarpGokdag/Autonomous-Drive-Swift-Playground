Swift Labyrinth Route Finder

An autonomous car also known as a self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.In this playground we have a simple matrix which is 4x4.Our vehicle will start from the right bottom corner and it will try to find a route.

# How It Works ? 

When we press to start button our autonomous car which is actually our computer will start to discover his/her around.We can simply think that our computer have a sensor and we will get results from our sensor which is (data), [ if our data = 0 ] the computer will think that it's our road  , but [ if our data = 1 ] the computer will understand that it's a barrier.

#  FAQ :

1-)What if there are two ("0") in our route , which ("0") is going to be selected ? 
Answer : Well , in real life there are different ways to find the route but in this playground we don't want a complexe algorithm.So the answer is , our computer will select ("0") randomly.

2-)Can Our Algorithm Exit From The Matrix System ? 
Answer : No it can't exit from our matrix because in our playground i've add a boundary limit.
