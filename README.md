Swift Labyrinth Route Finder

An autonomous car also known as a self-driving car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.In this playground we have a simple matrix which is 4x4.Our vehicle will start from the right bottom corner and it will try to find a route.

# How It Works ? 

When we press to start button our autonomous car which is actually our computer will start to discover his/her around.We can simply think that our computer have a sensor and we will get results from our sensor which is (data), [ if our data = 0 ] the computer will think that it's our road  , but [ if our data = 1 ] the computer will understand that it's a fucking barrier.
